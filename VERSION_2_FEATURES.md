# JACC Version 2.0 Feature List

## ISO Hub Integration (Hidden in V1)
**Status**: Complete but hidden from users
**Access**: Dev admin only (`role: 'dev'`)

### Features Completed:
- ✅ Enhanced OCR pipeline with GraphicsMagick and Tesseract
- ✅ PDF statement processing with authentic data extraction
- ✅ AI-powered analysis of Processing Activity Summary sections
- ✅ Interchange Fees section analysis
- ✅ Intelligent fallback system for document processing
- ✅ Real merchant data extraction from Genesis/ReyPay statements
- ✅ Progress indicators for OCR processing
- ✅ Statement upload and analysis interface
- ✅ ISO Hub authentication integration
- ✅ User synchronization between platforms
- ✅ SSO token handling and verification

### Current Access:
- Routes: `/iso-hub` and `/iso-hub-integration`
- Role restriction: `user?.role === 'dev'`
- Hidden from: Regular users, managers, admins
- Visible to: Development team only

### Data Accuracy Issues (To Fix in V2):
- Statement analysis producing inaccurate financial data
- Need improved AI prompt engineering for merchant statements
- Better field extraction from Processing Activity Summary tables
- Enhanced recognition of Interchange Fees sections
- More accurate processor identification from statements

### V2 Improvements Needed:
1. **Enhanced Data Extraction**
   - Train AI models on authentic merchant statement formats
   - Improve OCR accuracy for financial data tables
   - Better parsing of Processing Activity Summary sections
   - More accurate Interchange Fees calculation

2. **Statement Format Support**
   - Support for multiple processor statement formats
   - WorldPay statement analysis
   - First Data statement processing
   - TSYS statement parsing
   - Chase Paymentech statement analysis

3. **Accuracy Improvements**
   - Validate extracted data against known patterns
   - Cross-reference merchant information
   - Implement confidence scoring for extracted data
   - Add manual verification workflow

4. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Better progress indicators for long OCR processes
   - Real-time data validation feedback
   - Statement preview with highlighted extraction areas
   - Export capabilities for analysis results

## Access Control Implementation:
```typescript
// Current V1 Implementation
{user?.role === 'dev' && (
  <>
    <Route path="/iso-hub-integration" component={ISOHubIntegration} />
    <Route path="/iso-hub" component={ISOHub} />
  </>
)}
```

## Development Testing:
- OCR pipeline fully operational
- GraphicsMagick properly configured
- Tesseract extraction working
- Real merchant data being processed
- Authentication flow complete

## Next Steps for V2:
1. Fix data extraction accuracy issues
2. Improve AI analysis prompts
3. Add support for more statement formats
4. Implement user-facing interface
5. Add role-based access for regular users
6. Create training materials for sales agents
